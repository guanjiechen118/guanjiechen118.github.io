I am currently undertaking a PhD in Artificial Intelligence at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, under the supervision of [Yu Cheng](https://ych133.github.io/). Prior to this, I completed a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Nanjing University between 2020 and 2024, with rank 17/237. From 2022-2023, I served as an intern in Professor [Yinghuan Shi](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/shiyh/index.htm)â€™s research group at Nanjing University.
